                <h3>What was changed</h3>
                <p>1. Added a new database and uploaded it as a subdomain.</p>
                <p>2. Added modal on jacket specific images.</p>
                <p>3. Changed styles on home page.</p>
                <p>4. Changed styles and layout on About and Contact page.</p>
                <p>5. Smaller style changes on elements and cleaned up code in css-files.</p>
                <h3>How it was changed</h3>
                <p>1. I deleted the rainydays files from my domain when I started on the project exam so I could use the same domain again. Now, I added a new folder in the file manager and uplaoded the rainydays-files in there. Now it works as a subdomain.</p>
                <p>2. I made a function in javascript that creates a modal when you click the images on jacket specific page.</p>
                <p>3. I wanted to make some adjustments on the design, so I changed the layout on the review section from column to row on bigger screens and made the images smaller. I also changed the height of the header image and deleted the border line
                    on the bottom.</p>
                <p>4. I decided to do most of the styling again because the code was not well written. On the Contact page, I made the contact form center aligned instead of left aligned on all screen sizes.</p>
                <p>5. I cleaned up and deleted repeating code in css-files, I gave the same class to all buttons and made a global styling for them.</p>
                <h3>Why it was changed</h3>
                <p>1. It was necessary to learn how to use several databases on the same domain, also something I didn't know before the exam and wanted to learn how to do for future projects.</p>
                <p>2. To make the page more user friendly, and apply knowledge from previous assignments to this project.</p>
                <p>3. There were some parts of the design that I didn't like any longer and wanted to change to make it more appealing.</p>
                <p>4. The feedback from the first assignment delivery said that there was an issue on the about page between 800px and 1000px, where the content overlapped the footer. It also said that a center aligned form on bigger screens are more user
                    friendly, which I agree with.
                </p>
                <p>5. When going over the code I quickly saw that it was not very well written, so I tried to clean up the worst of it. I also had a lot of repeating code on the buttons, so I wanted to make a global one and rather do smaller changes on each
                    page if necessary.</p>
