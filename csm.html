                <h3>What was changed</h3>
                <p>1. Cleaned up code.</p>
                <p>2. Added validation on contact page.</p>
                <h3>How it was changed</h3>
                <p>1. I deleted repeating code in the css-files and code in some of the html-files that was not in use. I gathered elements with the same styling and gave them the same class, e.g. put styles of buttons in the global css-file instead of styling
                    them on each page. I noticed I had some repeating code in the media queries as well, that I deleted.
                </p>
                <p>2. Added paragraphs as error messages in the html-file and added javascript to make them appear if certain conditions have not been met. I also added validation that appears if the form has been successfully submitted.</p>
                <h3>Why it was changed</h3>
                <p>1. I wanted to go over the code and rewrite some of it to make it less messy. Looking back at this project, I definitely see that I have evolved when it comes to how I write code. For this project, I think the naming is messy, the way
                    I have written the css could have been done much easier and cleaner, which makes the files long and hard to read. I tried to clean up some of it, but focused on the most conspicuous.</p>
                <p>2. We had not covered javascript yet when I did this project, so I wanted to add validation to the form to improve the user experience and prevent users from feeling confused when using it.</p>
