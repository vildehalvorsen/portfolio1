                <h3>What was changed</h3>
                <p>1. Added search bar on blog page.</p>
                <h3>How it was changed</h3>
                <p>1. Added an input field in the html-file and styled it properly. I created an event listener that logs what ever is typed in the input field, but I did not figure out how to use til filter method. That is why I've left it with no function.</p>
                <h3>Why it was changed</h3>
                <p>1. Wanted to try the level 2/optional part of the exam and add a search field to make it possible for users to quickly make a search to find the posts that are more interesting to them.</p>
